    <p style="text-align:justify">Swift Limited is an Indian Global telecommunications services company based in bangalore,India. It operates in 20 countries.Among mobile operator groups globally, Swift ranked third (behind China Mobile) in the number of mobile customers (535 million) as of 2018. It provides GSM, 3G,4GLTE and VOLTE mobile sercvices.The evolution of Swift started in 1982 with the establishment of the Racal Strategic Radio Ltd subsidiary of Patrick Electronics which formed a joint venture with Millicom called 'Patrick', which evolved into the present day Swift.It competes with other major mobile operators including Airtel, Vodafone (pending the merger), BSNL, and Reliance Jio. Several smaller operators – Reliance Communications, Aircel, Telenor and Tata DoCoMo – with whom Swift competed are now in the process of closing down their businesses.While Swift competed very closely with operators like Reliance Communications, BSNL, Tata, Aircel in circa 2006–07, as of 31 December 2015,it has gone far ahead of the rest of these competitors with a Revenue Market Share of over 18.5% while the rest remain below 9%. Over the last 3 years,when Swift has cornered an incremental Revenue Market Share of 33% giving tough competition to market leaders Airtel and Vodafone by earning 1/3rd of the incremental market – way above its fair share of the market. </p>
